Hej, thanks for finding my page!

I'm a first-year PhD student from [AASS](https://www.oru.se/english/research/research-environments/ent/aass/), [Örebro University](https://www.oru.se/english/). My main focus is on the project "Robotic lab automation for handling power and granular materials.", which was founded by [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/) and is collaborating with Chalmers and WARA Robotics. My research interest includes robotic manipulation, machine learning, and multimodal perception. 

I am working with and supervised by [Johannes](https://www.oru.se/english/employee/johannesandreas_stork), [Henrik](https://www.oru.se/english/employee/henrik_andreasson), and [Yasemin](https://www.chalmers.se/en/persons/yaseminb/).
